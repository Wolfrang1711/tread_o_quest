# tread_o_quest

In our Webots robotic simulation for the 'Tread-O-Quest' competition, we've engineered a versatile bot capable of tackling multiple challenges. This bot adeptly follows lines and edges, conquers ramps, navigates walls, skillfully avoids obstacles, detects boundaries, and even showcases its status with LED displays. It's an all-in-one robotic contender, ready to excel in the multifaceted challenges of the 'Tread-O-Quest' competition, highlighting the synergy of cutting-edge technology and innovation in the world of robotics.

Round 1: Line and Wall following with LED status on the side on which it is following walls

Round 2: Edge following followed by ramp climb, After that obstacle avoidance while following a straight line, follow walls with LED status on the side following the wall and display number of obstacles count in LED status using binary upon reaching the end
